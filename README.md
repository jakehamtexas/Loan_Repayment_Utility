# Loan_Repayment_Utility
A simple console application that I built to help my parents monitor the status of a loan. Unit tests, SOLID, and Clean Code rules!

# Log Info
The program will create a log file that updates with a log entry every time a payment is processed through the application. IF the
application is ever published, be aware that the log file will be buried among the AppData, and it may become necessary to change
the prefix of the filepath string that govern where the log file is generated. Do this only if it is required that the log is available
to be easily accessed.
