# Loan_Repayment_Utility
A simple console application that I built to help my parents monitor the status of a loan. A clean code meditation, with some
reflection.

# Log Info
The program will create a log file that updates with a log entry every time a payment is processed through the application. If the
application is ever published, be aware that the log file will be buried among the AppData, and it may become necessary to change
the prefix of the filepath string that governs where the log file is generated. Do this only if it is required that the log is available
to be easily accessed.

# Dear Readers:
I did my best to make this as SOLID, clean, easy to read, and TDD as I could. It's a really short, simple application,
so it wasn't that challenging. All the same, if there is anything that you notice that could be improved upon, kindly inform me! I 
wanted to write an application that could be understood in under five minutes. I hope I succeeded!
